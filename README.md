# Sequence-conserved Enhancer-like Elements

The present repository contains the sequence-conserved enhancer-like elements (ELEs)
identified in 106 human tissues and cell types and the corresponding source codes.

## Source Data

The [`data`](data) folder provides the source data of this study.
The MD5 hash of each file is provided to help users verify the file integrity.

The `omnibus_bed.zip` file provides the following files.

| Name                       | Description                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `merge_human.bed`          | Omnibus ELEs                           |
| `merge_human_mouse_01.bed` | Lowly-conserved (LC) omnibus ELEs      |
| `merge_human_mouse_05.bed` | Moderately-conserved (MC) omnibus ELEs |
| `merge_human_mouse_09.bed` | Highly-conserved (HC) omnibus ELEs     |

Each row of each BED file in `omnibus_bed.zip` defines an omnibus ELE,
indicated by the chromosome, start and end positions.

```bash
$ head -n 1 omnibus_bed/merge_human_mouse_09.bed
chr1	746181	746729
```

The `context_specific_bed.zip` file provides the following files.

| Name                 | Description               |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| `human.bed`          | Context-specific ELEs    |
| `human_mouse_01.bed` | LC context-specific ELEs |
| `human_mouse_05.bed` | MC context-specific ELEs |
| `human_mouse_09.bed` | HC context-specific ELEs |

Each row of each BED file in `context_specific_bed.zip` defines
an ELE together with the tissue or cell type from which it is derived.
For example, `chr1:1167581-1168822` shown below is a HC context-specific ELE derived from the A549 cell line.

```bash
$ head -n 1 context_specific_bed/human_mouse_09.bed
chr1	1167581	1168822	A549
```

All the BED files are based on the GRCh37 (hg19) genome assembly. 

## Source Codes

The [`code`](code) folder provides the source codes of this study,
as well as a real-world example showing how to use the codes.
The MD5 hash of each file related to this example
is provided to help users verify the file integrity.

Our method requires the BED files of human H3K27ac and chromatin
accessibility peaks identified in the same context as input.
For example, the [`code/input`](code/input) folder provides
the BED files of H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility identified in embryonic large intestine.

| Name                                               | Description                   |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `hg19_ac_large_intestine_embryo_ENCFF906VKA.bed`   | H3K27ac peaks                 |
| `hg19_open_large_intestine_embryo_ENCFF276FKY.bed` | Chromatin accessibility peaks |

The [`code/example.sh`](code/example.sh) takes the BED files
of human H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility peaks as input,
and produces the ELEs with sequence conservation (LC, MC, HC) in the same context.
For example, the [`code/output`](code/output) folder provides the output
sequence-conserved ELEs for human embryonic large intestine.

| Name                                                   | Description               |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `hg19_mm10_01_hg19_large_intestine_embryo_ac_open.bed` | LC context-specific ELEs |
| `hg19_mm10_05_hg19_large_intestine_embryo_ac_open.bed` | MC context-specific ELEs |
| `hg19_mm10_09_hg19_large_intestine_embryo_ac_open.bed` | HC context-specific ELEs |

The [`code/intermediate`](code/intermediate) folder consists of intermediate files
that are produced by [`code/example.sh`](code/example.sh).
